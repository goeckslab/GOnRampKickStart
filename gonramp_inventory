# This is where you enter your hosts (target systems) and connection information
# eg:
#192.168.56.16 ansible_user="user" ansible_become_pass="sudo_pass" ansible_ssh_pass="ssh_pass"
# in this case, an ansible connection requires:
#	ansible_user: the user to connect to the remote host as
#	ansible_become_pass: the sudo password, if required*
#	ansible_ssh_pass: the ssh password for the ssh user*
# the relevant variable for using an ssh key is:
#	ansible_ssh_private_key_file: the path to your private ssh key*
#	  *: storing credentials in plain-text is risky; for other options, see:
